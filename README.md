# OpenGL Learning Project

This is a simple OpenGL project written in Rust, created as a part of my journey to learn OpenGL programming using the Rust programming language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HakanVardarr/opengl-rust.git
   cd opengl-rust
   ```

2. Build the project using Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Running the Project

Run the compiled executable using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following external dependencies:

- [glfw](https://crates.io/crates/glfw): GLFW bindings for Rust. It provides a simple and cross-platform library for creating windows and handling input.

- [gl-rs](https://crates.io/crates/gl): OpenGL bindings for Rust. It allows Rust code to interact with OpenGL functions and features.

Make sure to check the respective documentation for each dependency for additional details.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to [learn.opengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) for providing valuable tutorials and resources that helped in learning and implementing OpenGL concepts in this project.
